*Self Assessment*

Functionality - 3
The project follows the given interaction pattern with no errors, as well as follows the CL interaction patterns with zero errors as well.

OOP - 2.75
The project **is** broken into logical components, however the CodeRing is double the size of any other class. While the methods contained within are used in both Encode and Decode, it still could have been better implemented. In addition, CodeRing is poor naming convention.

Ruby Mechanics - 2.5
While the use of enumerables is properly implemented, it feels as though there could have been better enumerables used. A redeeming quality is that the law of Demeter is at most times followed due to use of helper methods.

TDD - 2.5
In creation of this project, everything was included in one file. At the point of functionality I then broke the class apart. While TDD was followed during the initial class build, it was strayed from when breaking the class up. Argumemnts could be made that all methods were already tested, but I draw issue with the fact the spec files for the broken up classes came after the classes themselves.

Overall - 2.68
